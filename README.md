# OpenSeaAPIPractice
OpenSeaAPIPractice is a pratice project using SwiftUI and Combine. I fetch assets from the specific owner and display the assets in grid. Feel free to click one of the asset to enter detail page where the image, the info and the web link are displayed. You could use imbedded web view or browser to open the permalink. A hack is that double-tapping the navigation title allows to clear cache which is convenient for testing.
